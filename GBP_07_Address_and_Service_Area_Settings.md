# GBP 07 — Address + Service Area Settings (West Michigan / Allegan 49010)

## Goal
Set up Google Business Profile correctly as a **service-area electrician** so:
- Google has a real “base location” for distance/proximity
- Customers see your **service area** (West Michigan), not your private address
- You reduce risk of suspension from an invalid address

---

## IMPORTANT RULES (read first — prevents suspension)
1. Google requires a **real physical address on file** (even if you hide it publicly).
2. The on-file address must be a location where you **actually operate** (home office is OK).
3. Do **NOT** use:
   - PO Boxes
   - UPS/mailbox stores
   - Virtual offices / coworking spaces you don’t staff
4. If you are not actually based in **Allegan, MI 49010**, replace the base city/ZIP with your real base.

---

## Step 1 — Decide your listing type
1. Open GBP Manager.
2. Click **Edit profile** → **Location**.
3. Choose the model that matches reality:
   - ✅ **Service-area business** (you go to customers) — most electricians
   - Storefront/office (customers visit you)

If you do not have walk-in customers, choose **Service-area business**.

---

## Step 2 — Enter your real on-file address (even if you hide it)
1. In **Location**, find **Business location / Address**.
2. Enter your **real address** (street + city + state + ZIP).
   - City: **Allegan**
   - State: **MI**
   - ZIP: **49010**
3. Save.

> Note: You do not need to publish the street address publicly if you don’t want customers arriving at your home.

---

## Step 3 — Hide your address from the public (service-area model)
1. In the same **Location** settings:
2. Find the option like:
   - “Show business address to customers”
3. Turn it **OFF**.
4. Save.

✅ Customers will not see your street address; Google still uses it internally for distance.

---

## Step 4 — Add your West Michigan service areas
1. In **Edit profile** → **Location** → **Service areas**
2. Add the cities/areas you truly serve (Google limits the number).
3. Use this suggested West Michigan list (edit to match your actual coverage):

### Suggested service areas (choose up to Google’s limit)
- Allegan
- Otsego
- Plainwell
- Wayland
- Hamilton
- Saugatuck
- Fennville
- Douglas
- Holland
- Zeeland
- Hudsonville
- Jenison
- Allendale
- Coopersville
- Grand Haven
- Spring Lake
- Muskegon
- Norton Shores
- Grand Rapids
- Wyoming
- Kentwood

4. Save.

**Rule:** Only add areas you will actually take jobs in.  
Google sometimes uses real-world behavior (calls, directions requests, customer locations) to evaluate legitimacy.

---

## Step 5 — Confirm your map pin (optional but recommended)
1. If Google shows a pin/edit map option:
2. Confirm the pin is accurate for your on-file address (even if hidden).
3. Save.

---

## Step 6 — Align your website wording with the same “base + service area”
On your website footer and contact page, use this exact phrasing (copy/paste):

**Top Tier Electrical Services • (616) 334-7159 • Based in Allegan, MI 49010 • Serving West Michigan**

If you do not want to show the ZIP publicly, you can use:
**Based in Allegan, MI • Serving West Michigan**

---

## Step 7 — Take a public-view verification screenshot (proof)
1. Open an Incognito window.
2. Search: **Top Tier Electrical Services**
3. Open your GBP panel.
4. Confirm:
   - Your street address is NOT shown publicly
   - Service areas are present
5. Screenshot and store in your “GBP Screenshots” folder.

---

## Troubleshooting
### If Google forces your address to display
- Double-check you’re set as a **service-area business**
- Remove “Storefront”/“customers visit” options
- If still stuck: contact GBP support and request address privacy

### If your listing disappears after address edits
- This can happen during review.
- Make sure the address is real and consistent with your website and citations.
- Prepare supporting proof:
  - Utility bill / business license / insurance document (showing the address)

---

## Success criteria
✅ Google has a real base (distance works correctly)  
✅ Your address is hidden publicly  
✅ Your service areas reflect West Michigan accurately
